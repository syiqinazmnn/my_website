        <p>
            Despite being 20 years old, I don‚Äôt have extensive formal work experience yet. My journey so far has been a collection of different informal experiences that have shaped who I am. 
            I had the privilege of completing an internship, which provided valuable insights into the professional world. But beyond that, I‚Äôve also explored various other experiences, 
            like exchanging books with friends and participating in fun events, which taught me the value of connection and sharing. These experiences have been instrumental in broadening 
            my perspective, and though my resume might not be long, I am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow. I am confident that with my willingness to work hard and embrace 
            new challenges, I will continue to develop both personally and professionally.

                <ul style="list-style-position: inside;">
                    <li style="line-height: 1.5;">During my internship at FELDA in the <i>JPMI Department</i> <b>(Human Resources)</b> under the <b>Operation Unit</b>, I gained valuable skills that helped me grow both personally and professionally. I worked under the guidance of <em>Miss Uswa</em> in the <b>Digital and Information Management Division</b>, which focuses on managing and digitalizing human resource systems.</li>
                    <li style="line-height: 1.5;">Throughout my internship, I learned to be adaptable and worked well in a team, especially during the Independence Week Carnival, where I gained hands-on experience in event coordination, sales management, and customer service. These experiences made me a more confident and well-rounded professional. I faced a few challenges during my internship. One of the biggest was managing correspondence. At first, I struggled with missing documents, but with help from Miss Uswa, I learned how to handle and file them properly. Another challenge was stepping in as the emcee for the retirement event at the last minute. Despite the pressure, I was able to manage and deliver a successful event, boosting my confidence.</li>
                    <li style="line-height: 1.5;">These challenges taught me valuable lessons about problem-solving, time management, and the importance of teamwork. They also helped me become more adaptable and confident in my professional abilities.</li>

It was a running event filled with colorful powder bombs and an energizing aerobics session. What made it truly special was that I participated with all my housemates, who were also in their first semester. It became a bonding experience that brought us closer together, creating memories we still cherish. It was so much fun!</p>

                  <p style="line-height: 1.5;">Organized by the UiTM Language Club, this pen pal program ran for about a month. It was an anonymous exchange where I used the pseudonym "Peanut" and my partner went by "Lucy." We exchanged letters through a mediator, who ensured our anonymity until the reveal on <strong>1st December 2023</strong>.</p>
                  <p style="line-height: 1.5;"></p>Through this program, I experienced the joy of getting to know someone solely through writing letters. We exchanged thoughts on music, TV shows, and life in general, despite having opposite tastes. When we finally met during a Google Meet session, it was both awkward and exciting! We bonded over our shared love for BTS and even exchanged social media handles.</p>

              <p style="line-height: 1.5;">During my secondary school days, my friends and I started a three-month-long book exchange program.
